## Contents

**Main.ipynb** :<br> The solutions for Q1 to Q5 and Q7(excluding Map Reduce) are written in Python and developed on Jupyterlabs(Anaconda). <br>
Caveat: To run the .ipynb files without error, the needed datasets are present in the *Dataset* folder. <br>
<br> For the bonus question, we did not provided the inverted index and vocabulary dataset explicitly.The implementation in this scenario deals with not that large number of documents and you can run the section associated with the bonus part to get the inverted_index and vocabulary. The expected time to get all the three required inverted_index and vocabulary is less than 1 min.
